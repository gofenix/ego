# Elixir
- everything is a process.
- process are strongly isolated.
- process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.
- message passing is the only way for processes to interact.
- processes have unique names.
- if you know the name of a process you can send it a message.
- processes share no resources.
- error handling is non-local.
- processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.


# Go
- simple, poetic, pithy
- don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating
- concurrency is not parallelism
- channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize
- the bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction
- make the zero value useful
- interface{} says nothing
- gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite
- A little copying is better than a little dependency
